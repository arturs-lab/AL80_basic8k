 Also, there are two typographical errors in the Source file, 
	probably made when the Basic source code was transcribed 
	from the original paper manual.

   Following the Label RECI1 you must add "INX  D" 
                    between the "STAX  D" and the "CALL  CKSUM"

 RECI1: CALL    CASI    ;INPUT BYTE
        STAX    D       ;STORE IT
        INX     D	;Add this line
        CALL    CKSUM   ;UPDATE CKSUM, PUT ADDR IN LIGHTS

   Following Label NOTCO, you must change "JNZ NOTCH" to "JNZ NOTBS"

 NOTCO:  CPI     7FH     ;TEST IF RUBOUT
         JNZ     NOTBS   ;BRIF NOT	(change this line)
         LDA     TAPES   ;GET PAPER TAPE SW

The ABOVE changes make the file match the manual.
